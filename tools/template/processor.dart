/**
 * Class used to store the Compilation unit, the basic unit the compiler
 * associates with each file.  This unit is used for each phase of the compiler.
 *
 * The current phases (in order) are PARSING, WALKING the HTML tree, ANALYZING
 * all files, and EMITTING Dart code and the HTML files.  Each phase progress
 * throw a process' state PROCESS_WAITING, PROCESS_RUNNING or PROCESS_DONE.
 *
 * A process waiting signals a particular phase (the current phase) is waiting
 * to run at some future time.  Only one process can run (single threaded).
 *
 * When a process is done the process transitions to it's next phase with a
 * process state of WAITING.
 *
 * When all processes phases are COMPLETE and each process state is DONE then
 * the NULL_PROCESS is returned signaling no more processes to run.
