  <pre>Here's some HTML with some triple quotes and escape sequences: '''
    This $text uses \r\n and \backslash \ to break your compiler.
  '''.
  But it hopes your compiler does not break!
  </pre>
  While we're at it, here's a cool entity: <span>&fnof;</span>
  <script type="application/dart">
    import 'dart:html';
    import 'package:web_components/watcher.dart';

    final text = 'Your escaping is bad and you should feel bad!';
    main() {
      window.setTimeout(() {
        dispatch();
        window.setTimeout(() => window.postMessage('done', '*'), 0);
      }, 0);
    }
