Web UI
===========

Web UI lets you build web apps as if you had a browser from the future. You can
use the cool new web technologies like [Web Components][wc],
and features like dynamic templates and live data binding inspired by
[Model Driven Views][mdv] and [Dart][d] today. Build apps easily using HTML as
your template language, express your application's components in HTML, and
synchronize your data automatically between Dart and your components.

We believe that:

- Web Components and MDV are on their way, we should start using them now.
- Cool new features should be made available to [modern browsers][mb] that
  haven't yet implemented them.
- Write/reload is just as important as write/compile/minimize/ship.
- Working in open source is the way to go.
- Developers from all backgrounds should be building awesome modern web apps.

Try It Now
-----------
Add the Web UI package to your pubspec.yaml file:

    dependencies:
      web_ui: any

Learn more at <http://www.dartlang.org/articles/dart-web-components/>.

See our [TodoMVC][] example [running][todo_live]. Read the [README.md][todo_readme] in
`example/todomvc` for more details.


Running Tests
-------------

Dependencies are installed using the [Pub Package Manager][pub].
```bash
pub install

# Run command line tests and automated end-to-end tests. It needs two
# executables on your path: `dart` and `DumpRenderTree` (see below
# for links to download `DumpRenderTree`)
test/run.sh
```
Note: to run browser tests you will need to have [DumpRenderTree][drt],
which can be downloaded prebuilt for [Ubuntu Lucid][drtlucid],
[Windows][drtwin], or [Mac][drtmac]. You can also build it from the
[Dartium and DRT sources][drtsrc].
